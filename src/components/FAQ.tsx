      question: "How does VibeSec scan my code?",
      answer: "VibeSec uses a combination of static analysis tools like Semgrep and AI-powered vulnerability detection to scan your codebase for security issues, exposed secrets, and known vulnerabilities."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you support private repositories?",
      answer: "Yes! VibeSec supports both public and private GitHub repositories. Simply connect using your GitHub token and we'll securely scan your private repos."
    },
    {
      question: "What do I get in the Basic plan?",
      answer: "The Basic plan includes AI-powered vulnerability scanning, detailed security reports, support for both public and private repos, and access to our developer community."
    },
    {
      question: "What does the AI report include?",
      answer: "Our AI-generated reports include detailed vulnerability descriptions, risk levels, potential impact analysis, and step-by-step fix instructions written for developers, not compliance officers."
    },
    {
      question: "Can VibeSec automatically fix code?",
      answer: "Currently, VibeSec provides detailed reports with fix instructions. Our Pro tier (coming soon) will include one-click automatic fixes for common vulnerabilities."
    },
    {
      question: "How secure is my data?",
      answer: "We take security seriously. Your code is scanned using secure tokens, we don't store your source code, and all data transmission is encrypted. We only retain scan results and reports."
    },
